# API Testing project :postbox: 

This is my API testing project. I used Postman test collections and Lord of The Rings API :neckbeard:

## Links

API - https://the-one-api.dev 

## How to run

Import test collection to your Postman :postal_horn:

## Tests

They are 15 tests in total. 

14 should pass :heavy_check_mark:

1 should fail - verify wikiURL :x:

My tests verify:

- status code
- data type
- empty / not empty properties
- accordance with data in collection variables
